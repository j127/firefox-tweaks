A `user.js` settings file to make Firefox better.

*UPDATE:* I've made a new version of Firefox customizations [over here](https://github.com/j127/Better-Firefox).

To apply these tweaks, copy the `user.js` file into your Firefox Profile and restart Firefox. Learn more about [Firefox Profiles](http://kb.mozillazine.org/Profile_folder) and the [user.js file](http://kb.mozillazine.org/User.js_file). Research each preference, and comment out ones that you don't want to change.

Alternatively, you can manually change them by typing `about:config` in the URL bar, and using the config search bar to look up the individual settings.
